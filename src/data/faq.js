    Question: "What projects are allowed?",
    Answer:
      "Almost anything you can think of! We accept websites to phone apps to video games and more! However, when incorporating an existing API into your project, the project must either uniquely utilize the API, serving a purpose unfulfilled by the original service, or it must utilize the API for a small part of the project rather than being a core component. As an example, a normal chatbot utilizing the OpenAI API would NOT be considered a unique use. If you are unsure as to whether your project counts as a unique use of an API, reach out to an E-board member for clarification.",
